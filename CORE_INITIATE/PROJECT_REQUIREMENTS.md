  - Toggle button to enable/disable triangulation mode
  - On hover over player point: draws connecting lines to teammates
  - Creates translucent triangle area showing team performance spread
  - Essential for understanding team cohesion and performance relationships

##### Damage Analysis Dock (Given vs Taken)
- **Player-wise Breakdown Toggle:**
  - Switches between team-aggregated and individual player damage display
  - **ON:** Stacked bars showing individual player contributions within team bars
  - **OFF:** Unified team damage bars (space-efficient approach)
  - Critical for detailed player performance analysis

#### D. Enhanced Visualization Switching
- **Carousel-Based Architecture:** Three slides (Race Chart, Scatter Plot, Damage Analysis)
- **Performance-Optimized:** Prevents DOM destruction through smart rendering
- **Smooth Transitions:** Fluid animations between different visualization types
- **Context Preservation:** Dock controls adapt automatically to active chart

#### E. Dock Visual Variations
