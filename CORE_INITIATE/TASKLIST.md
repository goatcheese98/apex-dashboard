## Current Sprint: Enhanced Dock System Development
### 🚀 Primary Dock Enhancement Tasks
- [🔄] Enlarge dock size to 450-500px × 80-90px dimensions
- [🔄] Make timeline scrubbing the most prominent dock feature
- [ ] Implement contextual dock controls based on chart type
- [ ] Add triangulation feature for scatter plot dock
- [ ] Add player-wise breakdown toggle for damage analysis dock
- [ ] Implement cumulative vs individual calculation logic

### 🎯 Special Features Implementation
- [ ] **Scatter Plot Triangulation:**
  - Toggle button for triangulation mode
  - Hover detection on player points
  - Dynamic line drawing between teammates  
  - Translucent triangle area highlighting
- [ ] **Damage Analysis Player Breakdown:**
  - Toggle for individual vs team-aggregated view
  - Stacked bar implementation for player contributions
  - Space-efficient display optimization
- [ ] **Universal Timeline Integration:**
  - Timeline scrubbing from 0 (pregame) to max games
  - Real-time data recalculation based on timeline position
  - Visual prominence and enhanced user interaction

#### Dependencies
- Current dock-iterations.vue implementation
- Vue 3 Composition API and reactive data structures

#### Notes
- Timeline scrubbing is THE primary feature - must be most visually prominent
- Creative freedom encouraged for dock layout experimentation
- All effects using pure CSS - no external animation libraries
