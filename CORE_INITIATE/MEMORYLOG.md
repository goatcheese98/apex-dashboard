### Current Architecture
- **Frontend Framework:** Vue 3 with Composition API + `<script setup>`
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS v4 with DaisyUI components
- **State Management:** Pinia for global state, Pinia Colada for data fetching
- **Build Tool:** Vite with Rolldown + OXC
- **Testing:** Playwright MCP for automated browser testing
- **Development Workflow:** Spec-driven approach with continuous monitoring

## User Preferences

### Coding Style Preferences
- **Component Pattern:** Always use Composition API with `<script setup>`
- **TypeScript Usage:** Strict TypeScript with interfaces preferred over types
- **Import Style:** Named exports preferred over default exports
- **Function Style:** Named functions for methods, arrow functions for callbacks
- **CSS Approach:** TailwindCSS utilities first, component classes when needed

- I prefer to use arrow functions for callbacks and named functions for methods (2025-07-23)
### Decision-Making Preferences
- **Planning First:** Always create detailed implementation plans before coding
- **Batch Implementation:** Build features in logical, manageable batches
- **Review Phase:** Detailed explanations of technical choices and alternatives
- **Safe Trials:** Comment out old code before implementing new approaches
- **Progress Tracking:** Regular Git commits after successful feature completion

### Communication Style Preferences
- **Workflow:** Specification → Implementation → Review phases
- **Explanations:** Technical rationale with reference to project guidelines
- **Alternatives:** Brief discussion of other approaches when relevant
- **Context:** Always explain "why" behind technical choices

## Technical Decisions

### Framework & Library Choices
- **Vue 3:** Chosen for modern reactivity system and Composition API
- **TypeScript:** Selected for type safety and better developer experience
- **TailwindCSS v4:** Utility-first CSS with improved performance and @theme directive
- **Pinia:** Lightweight state management replacing Vuex
- **Vite:** Fast development server with excellent Vue integration

- I prefer to use arrow functions for callbacks and named functions for methods (2025-07-23)
- **Created new Pinia store: auth.ts** (2025-07-23) - File: src/stores/auth.ts
### Architecture Patterns
- **File-based Routing:** Using Vue Router with unplugin-vue-router for type safety
- **Component Organization:** Separation by feature with reusable UI components
- **State Pattern:** Global state in Pinia stores, data fetching via Pinia Colada
- **Testing Strategy:** Playwright MCP for end-to-end testing and monitoring

### Development Patterns
- **Spec-Driven Development:** Planning and user approval before implementation
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Automated testing and issue detection via Playwright
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Start with semantic HTML, enhance with utilities
- **Performance First:** Optimized bundle size and runtime performance

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Limitations
- **API Integration:** Not yet connected to apexlegendsstatus.com API
- **Data Visualization:** Chart libraries not yet selected or integrated
- **AI Platform:** AI integration strategy not yet implemented
- **Mobile Optimization:** Responsive design not fully tested

### Planned Improvements
- **Phase 2:** Core race chart visualization with playback controls
- **Phase 3:** Damage analysis dashboard with team/player breakdowns
- **Phase 4:** Performance scatter plot with interactive exploration
- **Phase 5:** API integration with real tournament data

### Workarounds in Place
- **Development Data:** Using mock data until API integration
- **Testing Environment:** Playwright MCP provides automated testing coverage
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive guidelines in CORE/ directory for consistency

## Project-Specific Context

### Apex Legends Tournament Dashboard
- **Primary Goal:** Interactive data visualization for tournament analysis
- **Key Features:** Race charts, damage analysis, performance scatter plots
- **Target Users:** Tournament organizers, players, fans, analysts
- **Data Source:** apexlegendsstatus.com API
- **Performance Requirements:** 60fps animations, mobile-first design

### Critical Success Factors
- **Visual Clarity:** Information must be immediately understandable
- **AI Integration:** Deep insights available through AI querying
- **Floating Dock:** Context-aware control system for visualization switching
- **Multi-tournament Support:** Handle complex tournament structures
